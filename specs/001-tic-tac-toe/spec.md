# Feature Specification: Tic Tac Toe

**Feature Branch**: `001-tic-tac-toe`  
**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "i want to build a tic tac toe game that I can play against myself in my browser"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Play a full game (Priority: P1)

As a user, I can play a complete game of tic tac toe on a 3x3 grid on one device, taking turns as X then O, until there is a win or draw.

**Why this priority**: Delivers the core value of the game; enables immediate play and validation.

**Independent Test**: Start with an empty board, play legal moves alternating X/O to produce a win or a draw; verify game ends and blocks further moves.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given an empty board, When I tap a cell, Then it shows X and the turn changes to O.
2. Given a cell already marked, When I tap it again, Then nothing changes and the turn does not advance.
3. Given three in a line for the current player, When the third mark is placed, Then the game declares that player the winner and prevents further moves.
4. Given the board is full with no three in a line, When the last move is placed, Then the game declares a draw and prevents further moves.

### User Story 2 - Restart game (Priority: P2)

As a user, I can reset the board to start a new game at any time.

**Why this priority**: Allows repeated play and quick iteration after a game ends.

**Independent Test**: After any state (in-progress, win, or draw), activate restart and verify a clean empty board and default starting player.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a completed game, When I choose Restart, Then the board clears and a new game begins with X to play.
2. Given a game in progress, When I choose Restart, Then the board clears and any prior game state is discarded.

### User Story 3 - Indicate turn and outcome (Priority: P3)

As a user, I can see whose turn it is during play and a clear message when the game ends (win or draw).

**Why this priority**: Improves usability and reduces confusion during hot-seat play.

**Independent Test**: Observe turn indicator updates after each valid move; after win/draw, see an end-of-game message.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given X just moved, When the move is valid, Then the UI indicates O to play next.
2. Given a win is detected, When the winning move is placed, Then the UI shows "X wins" or "O wins" and no further moves are accepted.

---

### Edge Cases

- User rapidly taps multiple cells in succession: only the first valid tap applies per turn.
- Attempting to move after game end: no changes occur until restart.
- Restart pressed multiple times quickly: results in a single clean initial state.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST present a 3x3 grid with 9 selectable cells at game start (all empty).
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow a user to mark an empty cell with the current player's symbol.
- **FR-003**: System MUST alternate turns between players X and O, starting with X by default.
- **FR-004**: System MUST prevent marking an already-occupied cell and keep the same player's turn.
- **FR-005**: System MUST detect win conditions for rows, columns, and diagonals and declare the winner immediately.
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect a draw when all cells are filled without a winner and declare a draw.
- **FR-007**: System MUST display the current player's turn during gameplay and show a clear end-of-game message (win/draw).
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent any further moves once a win or draw is declared until the game is restarted.
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a Restart control that clears the board and resets the game to the initial state.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Board**: 3x3 collection of Cells; attributes: cells[0..8].
- **Cell**: Attributes: index (0–8), value (Empty | X | O).
- **GameState**: Attributes: currentPlayer (X|O), winner (X|O|null), isDraw (bool), isOver (bool), moveCount (0–9).

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A user can complete a full game (from empty board to win/draw) in under 2 minutes.
- **SC-002**: Win/draw detection is correct for 100% of the 8 winning lines and full-board draw scenarios (tested via manual checklist).
- **SC-003**: Invalid actions (tapping an occupied cell or after game end) result in no state change 100% of the time and provide visible feedback.
- **SC-004**: The board is fully visible and tappable on small phone screens without horizontal scrolling.
